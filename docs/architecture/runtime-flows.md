# Runtime flows

What holds on the main paths today and can't be seen by reading one file. Hand-written from the code; if this page and the code disagree, the code wins and this page is the defect. Package ownership is in [overview.md](overview.md). Routes, event payloads and tables are in the Generated Docs next to this page.

## Sign-up, login and session refresh

- Sign-up only creates the User and does not sign them in. This is intended MVP1 behaviour.
- The web app keeps the access token only in memory, so every page load first trades the refresh cookie for one.
- The refresh cookie is `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite=strict`, scoped to path `/api/v1/auth`.
- Refresh tokens are opaque and stored only as a hash. One conditional UPDATE rotates them. A token that is unknown, expired or already rotated away gets `401`, and the replay deletes the session that rotated it away.
- A request is accepted only if the access token verifies, is not on the deny-list, and its session still exists. Logout denies the token, deletes the session and pushes `session.revoked` to that session's sockets, so its other tabs sign out.

## Opening the socket

- A socket joins rooms for the User, the session and each Group the User is a current Member of.
- Group rooms are re-checked against the database after joining, so a membership change committed during the handshake is not missed.
- The access token is checked only at connect. A token that expires later does not close the socket.

## Sending a Message

- HTTP carries the write and the socket only delivers the result (ADR 0001). The sender gets the Message in the HTTP response and also over the socket; the web app merges the two by ID.
- The send transaction locks the Conversation row, requires that the sender is a Member, bumps `last_sequence` and inserts the Message.
- A reused `clientMessageId` from the same sender rolls back and returns `200` with the original Message and no push. A failed send's Retry reuses the id, so a retry can't duplicate.
- After the commit, a send waits for earlier commits of the same Conversation to finish their push (`CommitOrder`). This relies on the API being a single process (ADR 0006).
- A push is best effort: a failure is logged and never fails the send.
- The first Message to a User with no Direct Conversation goes to `POST /direct-messages`, which creates the Direct Conversation in the same transaction and pushes `conversation.created` to the recipient before the Message.
- Pushes for a Group go to its room, and for a Direct Conversation to each Member's User room.

## Read state

- A Member's Read Marker is a column on their membership row, so leaving or removal deletes it and a re-added Member starts fresh. It starts at the start of their membership period, so nothing from before joining is unread.
- `PUT /conversations/:id/read` moves the marker to the larger of the current one and `upToSequence`, clamped to the Conversation's last sequence, in one conditional UPDATE. It takes no Conversation lock and does not wait on `CommitOrder`. A Former Member has no row and gets `403`.
- Sending also moves the sender's own marker to the new Message, in the send transaction.
- Only a move pushes anything: `conversation.read` to the reader's own User room, which syncs their other tabs, and in a Direct Conversation `conversation.receipt` to the other User when both share read receipts. The setting is read after the commit, so turning it off stops later receipts. Like every push, these are best effort.
- The Unread Count is computed per Conversation in the list query: other Members' `text` Messages after the marker, capped at 100. A Former Member and a Closed Group always get 0.
- The web app marks read, debounced and retried, only while the tab is visible and the view is at its latest Message. A Message pushed while the User is reading adds nothing to the count.
- A `conversation.read` that covers the entry's last Message clears its badge. One that doesn't, or a push that overlaps a list fetch, makes the list reload from the server.
- A Direct Conversation's open view gets the other User's marker from `GET /conversations/:id` (`readUpToSequence`, present only when both share receipts) on open and after a reconnect, then from `conversation.receipt`. It only moves forward.

## Loading a Conversation and its history

- A reader sees only Messages whose sequence falls inside one of their membership periods. That is how a Former Member keeps what they were present for and nothing later.
- The Conversation list stays current from pushes, including each entry's last-Message preview and Unread Count. It reloads when a push names a Conversation it doesn't list, or when a Group ends for the User.
- After the socket reconnects, the web app reloads the list and fetches the open Conversation's Messages with `?after=` its newest sequence, page by page, merging by ID.
