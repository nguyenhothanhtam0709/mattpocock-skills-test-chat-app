# Ticket status

A Ticket's `**Status:**` line is its state. The values are the five labels in [triage labels](../agents/triage-labels.md) plus `resolved`.

## Who may move a Ticket

| From                                   | To                                     | Who                                                                                                     |

| `needs-triage`                         | any label, or `wontfix`                | The human. An agent may propose a Status with `triage`.                                                 |
| `ready-for-agent` or `ready-for-human` | `needs-info`                           | The agent working the Ticket, or the human.                                                             |

| `ready-for-agent`                      | `ready-for-human`, and back            | The human only.                                                                                         |
| `ready-for-agent` or `ready-for-human` | `resolved`                             | The Actor implementing it, in the last commit of its PR. It counts only once the PR is merged.          |

## Taken Tickets

There is no "in progress" Status. A Ticket is taken when its Task Branch (`agent/NNNNN-NN-<slug>`) or draft PR exists. The Orchestrator assigns Tickets, so two agents never start the same one.

## Spec status

A Spec's `spec.md` also has a `Status:` line. It is `ready-for-agent` once the Spec is on `main`, and it is set to `resolved` through a task PR when every Ticket is `resolved`.
